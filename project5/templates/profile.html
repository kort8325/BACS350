    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Hello everyone my name is Vicente Ramos and this will be my third year at UNC. 
        I graduated from Aims in 2018 with a Business Administration degree and I wanted to continue my education which is why decided to come to UNC. 
        Prior to coming to here I didn't know which area of business I wanted to get into. 
        But after doing some research I decided to settle for CIS because it looked like a well rounded degree that offers flexibility upon graduation. 
        I also have a minor in computer science just because I wanted to learn more programming languages other than C#. </p>
